# ⌨️ Task 04: Keylogger Program  
**SkillCraft Technology Cyber Security Internship**

---

## 📘 Overview

This project demonstrates how system-level keystrokes can be logged using Python. It is built using the `pynput` library and logs all user keystrokes to a local file.

> ❗ **Strictly for educational purposes only**  
> ❗ Do not run on systems without user consent  
> ❗ This project is compliant with SkillCraft's ethical standards

---

## 🔐 Features

- ✅ Logs all typed keystrokes in real time  
- ✅ Includes timestamps and formatting for special keys  
- ✅ Saves to a local log file (`logs/keylog.txt`)  
- ✅ Stops cleanly on pressing **ESC key**

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

- Used `pynput` to capture low-level keyboard input  
- Learned how keyloggers work at a basic level  
- Understood the ethical implications of system access tools  
- Implemented safe logging, termination, and local-only usage

## ⚠️ Ethical Disclaimer

This keylogger was built **solely for educational learning**.  
Do not run this on anyone else's computer. This script:
- Logs only locally
- Shows console warnings
- Allows easy manual termination with ESC
